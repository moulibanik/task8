📚 Project Overview
This repository contains Task 8 of the SQL Developer Internship Program, focusing on Stored Procedures and Functions in MySQL.

The project demonstrates:

Creating and using a stored procedure to filter employee records by department.
Defining a function to calculate a bonus (10% of salary) for each employee.
Use of parameters (IN), return values, and clean modular SQL logic.
Through this, I’ve applied best practices in database scripting, ensuring the code is reusable, maintainable, and scalable—qualities essential in real-world software development.

🔧 Technologies: MySQL Workbench
📁 Contents: SQL Script, README, Sample Queries, Optional Screenshots
🎯 Goal: Master reusable SQL logic using Stored Routines
